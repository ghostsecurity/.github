# .github

## Centralised GitHub config

The theory goes that the `.github` repository is a special case and templates can be dropped in there for PR_TEMPATE and ISSUE_TEMPLATE etc. New repos will automagicaaly the the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` as a sensible PR template.

Projects can still have a `.github` folder of their own with templates in, these will always trump the Org wide one
